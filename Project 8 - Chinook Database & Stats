# I used the chinook database, containing 11 tables, to answer the following questions:

-- 1) Show customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US 

SELECT customerID, FirstName, Lastname, Country
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country <> 'USA'; 

-- 2) Show only the Customers from Brazil 

SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil'; 

-- 3) Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
-- The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, date of the invoice, and billing country

SELECT cust.Firstname, cust.Lastname, invo.InvoiceId, invo.InvoiceDate, invo.BillingCountry 
FROM chinook.invoices invo

LEFT JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON invo.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 

WHERE invo.BillingCountry = 'Brazil'; 

-- 4) Show the Employees who are Sales Agents 

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title 
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent'; 

-- 5) Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table 

SELECT DISTINCT(BillingCountry)
FROM chinook.invoices; 

-- 6) Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent (include their fullname)

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, invo.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.employees emp 

JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices invo
ON cust.CustomerId = invo.CustomerId; 

-- 7) Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, invo.Total
FROM chinook.employees emp 

JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices invo
ON cust.CustomerId = invo.CustomerId;

-- 8) How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(InvoiceId)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'; 
--OR 
SELECT COUNT(InvoiceId)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'; 

-- 9) What are the total sales for 2009? 

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%';
--OR
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

-- 10) Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line item. 

SELECT track.Name, item.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.invoice_items item

JOIN chinook.tracks track
ON item.TrackId = track.TrackId;

-- 11) Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line item

SELECT track.Name AS track_name, 
art.Name AS artist_name, 
item.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks track

JOIN chinook.albums al
ON track.AlbumId = al.AlbumId 
JOIN chinook.artists art
ON al.ArtistId = art.ArtistId
JOIN chinook.invoice_items item
ON track.TrackId = item.TrackId; 

-- 12) Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre

SELECT 
track.Name AS track_name, 
al.Title AS album_name, 
media.Name AS media_type, 
genre.Name AS genre_name
FROM chinook.tracks track

JOIN chinook.albums al
ON track.AlbumId = al.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.media_types media 
ON track.MediaTypeId = media.MediaTypeId 
JOIN chinook.genres genre
ON track.GenreId = genre.GenreId; 

-- 13) Show the total sales made by each sales agent 

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, ROUND(SUM(invo.Total), 2) AS total_sales
FROM chinook.employees emp 

JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices invo
ON cust.CustomerId = invo.CustomerId

GROUP BY emp.EmployeeId; 

-- 14) Which sales agent made the most in sales in 2009? 

SELECT emp.FirstName, 
emp.LastName, 
ROUND(SUM(invo.Total), 2) AS total_sales
FROM chinook.employees emp 

JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices invo
ON cust.CustomerId = invo.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND invo.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%' 
GROUP BY emp.EmployeeId
ORDER BY (ROUND(SUM(invo.Total), 2)) DESC
LIMIT 1;
