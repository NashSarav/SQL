-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle 
-- Then, I created a table and imported the Spotify data.csv file 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

-- I explored the data using the following SQL: 

#1 Average popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track

SELECT 
artist_name, 
track_name,
AVG(popularity) AS avg_popularity,
AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability, 
AVG(energy) AS avg_energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name; 

#2 Top 10 artists and tracks by popularity  

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10; 

#3 Average speechiness, acousticness, and instrumentalness of Top 10 tracks 

SELECT 
AVG(speechiness) AS avg_speechiness,
AVG(acousticness) AS avg_acousticness,
AVG(instrumentalness) AS avg_instrumentalness 
FROM 
    (SELECT *
    FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
    ORDER BY popularity DESC
    LIMIT 10);
